## Task Taker

A small task taking app built with Typescript, React (using Vite), Express.js, Tailwind, and a mock database using a JSON file.
I hhadn't written an Express server with "vanilla" React in a while, so I made this to get my feet wet again.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CN-M/express-server.git
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

To run the client

```bash
pnpm run client
```

To run the server

```bash
pnpm run server
```

To run the client and server concurrently

```bash
pnpm run project
```

You can set the port for the server in the .env file. The default is 3000.

```bash
PORT=8000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
